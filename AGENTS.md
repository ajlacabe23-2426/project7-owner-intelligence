# Project 7 — Owner Intelligence — Agent instructions

## Operating contract

Mission: Evidence-linked owner/operator briefs using deterministic prioritization and transparent operator feedback.

Read `README.md`, existing task and roadmap records, relevant PRs/commits and workflow configuration before edits. Preserve existing behavior and task ownership. A clear assignment authorizes scoped, reversible branch work, including implementation, tests, review, commits, pushes and draft PRs. Do not invent activity just to keep a branch busy.

## Strict stop boundaries

Do NOT merge into `main`, production-deploy, apply hosted data migrations, mutate hosted data or credentials, enable paid services, spend money, communicate with real customers, publish publicly, live-trade, delete hosted resources, or rewrite shared history without explicit action-specific human approval. A task's general autonomy instruction does not waive these stops.

## Product boundary

Keep synthetic/local sources clearly labeled. Never turn observations into causal claims or sales/revenue proof. Source references must identify the exact data that supports each finding. Do not ingest confidential business data or deploy public endpoints without approval and authentication controls.

## One task, one candidate

Use `.codex/CURRENT_TASK.md` when an active task exists; otherwise read `docs/ROADMAP.md` and open issues to choose a bounded task. An active task records ID, objective, scope, tier, base SHA, acceptance criteria, non-goals and required gates. Do not overwrite another task in VERIFYING or READY_FOR_AJ. Record historical evidence in PRs/issues or `.codex/completed/`.

State machine: `NO_ACTIVE_TASK -> ACTIVE -> IMPLEMENTING -> VERIFYING -> CORRECTIONS_REQUIRED -> IMPLEMENTING -> VERIFYING -> READY_FOR_AJ -> COMPLETE`. Only the owner accepts COMPLETE. Freeze an exact commit SHA; every PASS must describe checks on that same candidate, or identify an older/stale result. A post-freeze edit invalidates affected gates. Never call an unrun check a PASS.

## Risk / verification

TIER_0: non-runtime docs; TIER_1: ordinary product UI/logic; TIER_2: user/API/persistence/provider/financial calculations; TIER_3: authorization, migration, privacy/data plane. Escalate based on real changes. Reviewer + focused checks for all tiers; security/integration for TIER_2+; ownership/negative tests, rollback and recovery assessment for TIER_3. Add UX or performance gates where relevant.

Project gates: Run FastAPI/unit regression suite, deterministic input replay, source-consistency and missing-evidence negative tests, operator disposition/outcome checks, dependency review and CI.

## Review packet

Return objective, changed paths, branch, full candidate SHA, PR link, executed checks with PASS/FAIL/NOT_RUN and exact revisions, residual risks, unverified behavior, manual acceptance checklist, and the smallest explicitly authorized action requested of the owner.
